## Projects covered in the course:

* Food Vision: Image classifier of 101 different kinds of food. [View code here](https://github.com/dbarrau/TensorFlow_training/blob/main/07_mileston_project_1_food_vision.ipynb)
* Skimlit: Goes through RCT abstracts and classifies sentences into categories of background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusion. [Check the code out here](https://github.com/dbarrau/TensorFlow_training/blob/main/09_SkimLit_nlp_milestone_project_2.ipynb)
* Bitpredict: Time series forecasting of Bitcoin Prices. Please do consider that time forecasting series of random walks cannot be really forecasted, and only approximated to a Naive model.
